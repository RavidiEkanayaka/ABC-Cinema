# ABC-Cinema

ABC PVT Ltd. is the largest and the most premium film exhibition company in Sri

than 75+ Sinhala Movies, 60+ Hollywood Movies, 40+ Bollywood Movies and 25+ Tamil 
Movies. ABC Cinema has the highest box office shares of independent foreign language films 
in the country. Currently ABC operates a cinema circuit of 120 Screens at 68 Properties in
several Cities in Sri Lanka.
And in our project, we use servlets, jsp in java language to develop this website 
properly. As well we added owl carousel to create responsive carousel sliders.
The ABC cinema currently showing 4 movies and customers can get more details about 
the movies, as well they can book several seats also. In the seat booking page customer can 
configure the total that they need to pay and how many seats they ordered currently. Here we 
connect PayPal as a payment gate way. So, customers can do their payments using Papal 
account or Using their Credit/Debit cards. And the one of special thing is they must do their 
payment in USD (US Dollars) because PayPal isn’t working for LKR. And another special 
thing is if the customer needs to cancel the seats, they can go back from the PayPal payment 
page so then it will automatically canceled. But after customer do the payment, they cannot 
cancel the seat and won’t reject the payment as well. 
ABC Cinema web site we added several pages as home page, location page, about page, 
feedback page, and e ticket page. The database connection is done with feedback page. This 
page connected to a data base using servlets. It will save the messages that send by customers 
as their feedbacks. And we added our team members to the about page and you can contact 
them using LinkedIn by clicking their names that we added to the about page.
